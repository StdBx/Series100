Series100
=========

StdBx is a set of tools and libraries intended to make it easy to create professional looking control and display panels for your electronics DIY projects.  Series100 is a design point for an enclosure that looks like this:

The panels fit into an enclosure that has mounting for the circuit boards and end panels.  The enclosure design is provided in .stl format that can be printed on a 3d printer or ordered from a 3d print service company like [MakeXYZ](http://www.makexyz.com/) or [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/).  

Series100 adds a library and a CAM file to the EagleCAD PCB design software.  As you design your circuit board the front panel is designed along with it.  It is easy to use following these steps.  

  1. Design your circuit using Eagle's schematic capture tool.  For displays, buttons, switches, encoders, potentiometers and LEDs choose components from the Series100 library.  Include the Series100 board definition from the library.  
  2. Place the display and control components (along with the other components used in your design) using Eagle's PCB layout tool.  
  3. Add any text labels you would like to have on the panel.  
  4. Export the panel definition using the CAM file and scripts provided.  
  5. Order your panel from a laser cutting service like [Pololu](http://www.customlasercutting.com/) using the exported files.

That's it.  The board and the panel fits accurately and securely in the enclosure.  Together they allow your unique project to look like it just rolled off the manufacturing line.

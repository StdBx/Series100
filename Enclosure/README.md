===================

The StdBx Series100 is a box for your electronic projects.  The size is 4.25"W x 2.375"H x 4.1875"D.

Series100 Inside 

As you can see in this picture the StdBx system is based on a mechanical architecture similar to that used by any number of other instruments. There is an acrylic faceplate with a PCB behind it. The PCB is small enough to be designed with the free version of Eagle CAD, but can have a little over 8.5 square inches of circuitry. If that's not enough, the enclosure supports more PCBs on the back panel and floor of the enclosure for a total of 26.5 square inches of circuitry. You can add even more PCBs if you get creative by stacking. You don't have to use that much PCB but it's available if you need it.  

The floor of the enclosure is also sized to fit a 4xAA cell battery holder for more portable projects. You can use standard panel mount connectors on the back panel instead of a PCB. The two shown are a barrel jack for power and a rugged USB-mini-B connector with FTDI serial converter.

The enclosure is assembled from two identical pieces.  The two pieces are fastened with two screws on each side.  Together they capture the front and back panels and their associated PCBs.  There are mounting bosses for the third PCB on the bottom of the enclosure.

The file Series100halfcaseRev3.1.stl in this folder is the mechanical definition for the enclosure.  You can print the file on your 3D printer or order it from 3D print companies like [MakeXYZ](http://www.makexyz.com/) or [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/).  We have used both sources and the resulting prints work great.

The pieces we have tested from MakeXYZ were printed from PLA at a 200 micron layer height.  The pieces from Shapeways were printed from their "Strong & Flexible Plastic" material.
